# password-generator
For this week's challenge we were tasked with deploying a functioning password generator.

# Deployment Link


# Description
An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
This generator works by making the user pass through a series of prompts.
Through these prompts, users are meant to decide the overall characteristics of their generated password.
The characterisitcs include length, whether to include uppercase and/or lowercase characters, etc.
For these prompts the use must note that **OK = YES** and **Cancel = NO**.

Find an image below of the site with an example of a generated password:

For the above example, I made the choice to exclude uppercase characters.
